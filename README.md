Code related to the thesis "On galaxy rotation curves and alternative gravity theories" for Bachelor Degree in Physics, October 2023, at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano,
by Alessandro Musmeci.

This C++ code calculates the rotation curves for a separable disk with exponential surface density and different thickness profiles in newtonian physics. Only adimensional formulas are calculated. 
The code produces a machine-readable file with 3 columns: the reduced distance $\tilde{r}$, the rotation velocity, and the error on the integral.
